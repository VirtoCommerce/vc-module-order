The Order module in Virto Commerce is a document based flexible orders management system with possibility to add unlimited number of documents related to customer order.

The Order module main purpose is to store order details and manage orders created by users on client side. This module is not designed to be a full order processing system like ERP but serves as storage for customer orders details and can be synchronized with different external processing systems.

The order itself contains minimum details, when the documents present additional order details, like payment, shipment, etc.  and display the order management life cycle.

The order management process in Vitro Commerce OMS is not coded and not pre-determined. This system is designed as an Order Details Editor with no validation logics available. The system is implied to be an additional storage for customer orders details.

## Key features

Virto Commerce Order module supports the following functionalities:

* Status update for each document type.
* Document based order structure. The order contains related documents such as Payments, Shipments, Addresses, etc. The order, being a document itself, is also a container for all documents related to the order processing: shipping, payment, custom documents. This approach allows mapping of supplier internal business processes of any complexity (multi-shipments, multi payments, specific inventory operations) to VirtoCommerce order structure. So it makes possible to keep track of documents begot by each order and show it to a customer if required.
* Ability to view and manage fulfillment, packages, pick-up and shipments documents.
* Dynamic extensibility of the 'Order Documents' (possibility to add custom fields). It is relatively easy to implement additional data for existent documents and new kinds of custom documents to the order container.
* Manage additional invoices.
* Save order drafts (postponed confirmation of order changes).
* Changing Order products (quantity, product change, new products).
* Possibility to make changes to order product price.
